              Zhixiang Architects was established in Beijing in 2008. <br>
              <br>

In the course of 13 years of design practice, in the face of complex and diverse design cues, "site", "light" and "construction" are our continuous focus.
<br>
<br>
We believe that no building can exist without the "site". And every site must have some kind of energy that it already exists there, it may be a beautiful nature, a busy city fragment, or it may be vivid people and behaviors. What architecture needs to do is to reveal this energy through precise spatial movements and transform it into human perception and life. It's like a stone that's been put into water, and ripples are created around it, and we're aware of the movement of the water. In this sense, architecture is not the beginning nor the end, it is a medium, a medium of connection and presentation.
      <br>
<br>
"Light" is another constant focus of ours. While natural light manifests fixed, tangible matter and boundaries in space, it also dissolves their physical limitations. Light is an energy that imparts the mood and atmosphere that pervade a space. As the sun moves through the day, weather and seasons change, this invisible quality is forever changing. In our opinion, light for architecture is not only a kind of "watching" in a visual sense, but also a "immersion" in a physical sense.
<br>
<br>
Architecture is ultimately the art of "building". In China, many "lagging", "chaos" and "defects" in the construction industry are precisely the power that architects can borrow and transform. We adhere to our "Stay with the Workers" strategy. For each project, we will have an architect dispatched to the construction site to participate in the whole process of construction - from the initial field research and experiment of material practices, the testing and correction of structural nodes, to the later on-site supervision and cooperation to ensure the implementation of the construction. plan for design. It is this long process of running-in and collaboration that gives us more opportunities to absorb the construction wisdom from local and on-site workers in real time, and constantly correct the limitations and deviations in the design drawing stage.
